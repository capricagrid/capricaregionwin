Pay attention!
In order to start a hypergrid region connected to Caprica Hypergrid, you need to have a static IP address.
Make sure you have it. Dynamic addresses are not suitable for this purpose.

git clone https://github.com/capricagrid/capricaregionwinwin.git
or
download zip file: https://github.com/capricagrid/capricaregionwin/archive/refs/heads/master.zip
unzip files in your folder
-----------------------------------

Step 1.
Open ...\capricaregionwin\bin\Regions\Regions.ini
Please, check the Map first, before enter region location! https://caprica.xyz/simple-map/
Change Region name, RegionUUID, Location, SizeX;Y, InternalPort and ExternalHostName to your values.
To generate a UUID for your region, use the Gridlist UUID generator: https://gridlist.ru/uuid/
Save and exit

Step 2. (optional!)
Open ...\capricaregionwin\bin\config-include\GridCommon.ini
[DatabaseService] Select your preferred database server. By default, Caprica Hypergrid regions use the MySQL database server. Create a MySQL database, and provide a username and password in this config file. 
Save and exit

Step 3
Open  ...\capricaregionwin\bin\OpenSim.ini
in line 48 find  http_listener_port and port number, and change it to your port number. Don't forget, this port must be accessible and not blocked by a firewall.
Save and exit

Step 4
Make sure that ports 9000, 8003, 8002, the port you specified in OpenSim.ini configuration file and the port of your region are accessible from outside.
Make sure the settings specified in the "hosts" file are correct:
    Press the Windows key.
    Type Notepad in the search field.
    In the search results, right-click Notepad and select Run as administrator.
    From Notepad, open the following file: c:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts.
    Make the necessary changes to the file.

127.0.0.1   localhost
[your external IP]   localhost

    Select File > Save to save your changes.

Start OpenSim.exe in /bin folder

Enter the Estate name.
Enter the first and second name of your avatar registered with Caprica Hypergrid.
Wait for the message "Login enabled" in the terminal.
If you encounter error messages while starting your region, check your settings carefully again.
